### Project Goals

The project is divided into two main phases, each involving specific tasks and objectives:

_Phase #1:_

1. Utilize the ChatGPT API within Jupyter Notebook to create a chatbot that can interact with users.
2. Use Gradio to develop a web application that allows users to interact with the chatbot.
3. Implement NLP techniques to parse user input and extract entities to improve the chatbot's response accuracy.
4. Acquire a comprehensive understanding of ChatGPT parameters to enable better chatbot performance.
5. Calculate ChatGPT temperature parameter based on user input for more precise responses.

_Phase #2:_

1. Perform in-depth NLP analysis to enhance the chatbot's ability to parse user input.
2. Create a web application using Streamlit to provide an improved user experience.
3. Implement prompt engineering techniques to improve the chatbot's natural language generation capabilities.

> The project team will allocate appropriate resources to each phase and task in order to achieve project objectives in a timely and effective manner.

### Libraries Used

**OpenAi**
--> An OpenAI key was utilized to generate an environment variable that facilitated the opening of a testing site, which was instrumental in assessing the relationship between user interaction and the bot's performance.

**Gradio**
--> Gradio was employed to automatically generate a public link that grants access to the mentioned environment above.

**Spacy**
--> The Spacy framework played a crucial role in the development of the get_param() method, primarily by facilitating the conversion of user input into a comprehensible format for iteration. Additionally, Spacy was utilized to iterate through each of the input entities as demonstrated.

**RapidFuzz**
--> RapidFuzz was instrumental in the construction of the get_param() method and played a significant role in the iteration through user input within the environment key.
